This is an app where a user can play a stock trading game.
The user starts with a million dollars and can trade stocks to see how well he/she can do over any period of time.

The app is still in development and it isn't live. This is my third app using Reactjs/Redux.
I am feeling much more comfortable with the technology.


How I start both servers on my machine:
starting api server:
  under src/server type node entry.js

starting static server:
  webpack-dev-server --port 3001
